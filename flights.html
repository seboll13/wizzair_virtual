                    <p style="color: white;">The main base of Wizzair is Budapest. It is the capital of Hungary and is one of the most beautiful European cities
                    you can visit. It features really tall hills by the side of the Danube River, which passes through the city, and both can be seen during the approach for runways 13L and 13R.</p>
                    <p style="color: white;">Budapest is also known for having the oldest subway system in continental Europe. It has been around since 1896.
                    Its airport serves most of Hungary, with the only other passenger airport being Debrecen. It has been in operation since then 1950s, and it has 2 passenger terminals though since 2012, only the second one is used for passengers.
                    Budapest Ferenc Liszt airport has parallel runways which make it very enjoyable for pilots when approaching the city.</p>

                <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
                    <p style="color: white;">Wizzairs first variant is based in London Luton airport which plays the role of a budget gateway to UK’s capital – London. It is not only a favorable place for sightseeing, but also a really important business hub. Luton itself is a small town north of London. A car production facility was in operation there between 1905 and 2002.</p>
                    <p style="color: white;">London Luton airport is the go-to for a lot of people who want to visit London and who wouldn’t mind taking a bus to London itself as it probably compensates the price they have payed for their tickets. Luton airport is a base airport for Wizzair and EasyJet. A few other airlines also operate there often, such as TUI and Ryanair. The airport features a relatively short runway, which makes it exciting to land at and take off from.</p>

                    <p style="color: white;">We finally have Abu Dhabi airport, which is a gateway to another important business hub, and home to Wizzair Abu Dhabi – Wizzairs UAE subsidiary.</p>
                    <p style="color: white;">Abu Dhabi is a beautiful city. For the regular tourist, the tall skyscrapers are going to be really appealing and for the passionate of automobiles or airplanes, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and Abu Dhabi Air Show are definitely worth the detour. It’s best to visit Abu Dhabi during the spring or autumn, as it gets unbearably hot during the summer.</p>
                    <p style="color: white;">Abu Dhabi airport is really big as it spreads over 3400 hectares. It features 2 runways and 3 passenger terminals. Etihad and Wizzair Abu Dhabi are based there, along with many other airlines who regularly operate there such as Air Arabia, Turkish Airlines or Air India.</p>
